# Welcome to my District Proposal
By popular request I have updated the proposal, to provide more specific details and provide more of an outline to the district.

### Basic Description
Chobury is a district with areas with apartment's and other high density personal property, leading into lots of commercial business areas, which will sell and provide services.

### How will the district be run?
The district will be run as a democratic state, we are still up for discussion on the type of democracy, but currently we are looking at a direct democracy, where the people directly vote on everything that the city will do, without democratic leaders.

### Team
##### Project Leader:

##### Looking for more members DM me <3

### Hmmm... Whats the Point?
The goal of this district is to provide a place for people to enjoy themselves. Current ideas being an underground Club/Bar, where we have a DJ playing music and run events, such as an open mic night, talent shows, quiz nights and just general socialising. We are also going to provide areas for modern shops, for people to browse around and enjoy. These stores will have many experiences you just couldn't get while browsing online.

### Other
###### Catagory:
           Public
###### Land Needed:
           As much as possible
###### Startup Costs:
           It is a goal of the project to outsource some scripting or 3D Modelling, so money would be nice, but we will be able to get by doing it ourselves/volunteers.
###### How will funds be distributed:
           I am working on a new pie chart. However I am looking to have a 5% to founding team 25% to original stakers and 70% back into the city, however all these numbers will probably change.
###### How will contributes see a return value:
           They will own some land in the city and be citizens of the city and lifetime city membership and 25% of profits.
###### How will the city gain profits
- Selling/renting property
- Rent
- City Memberships (For non residents to get extra city functions like ad free.)
- Digital Dynamic Advertisements (Dm me for more information)

#### Modern Store Front 
Yes I understand we all hate apple, but you have got to admit some of the stores look nice. Coming from a stern apple hater.

#### Bar/Club/Expo Center idea
Again we all hate apple, but I like the idea of the underground facility with the sloping down entrance, and it allows to maximize social space.
